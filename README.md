# **hagenberg-thesis** Document Collection (LaTeX)

## What you find here

This is a collection of modern LaTeX classes, style files and example documents for authoring Bachelor, Master or Diploma theses and related academic manuscripts in English and German. Pre-configured documents for English and German are available, easy to use even for LaTeX beginners and compatible with LaTeX distributions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

The main document ([**HgbThesisTutorial**](https://github.com/Digital-Media/HagenbergThesis/raw/master/examples/HgbThesisTutorial/main.pdf))
serves both as a template and tutorial for authoring a Bachelor, Master or Diploma thesis using LaTeX. 
It is the common standard for theses at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - School of Informatics, Communication and Media and also in use at other (mostly German-speaking) universities. 
The document classes are immediately usable and easy to adapt. They should work in any modern LaTeX environment.

This is the main repository for the **hagenberg-thesis** package, which is also available
on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/hagenberg-thesis) and shared by popular package repositories
such as [*MikTeX*](https://miktex.org/) and [*TexLive*](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

**NOTE:** Typical users should **NOT clone THIS REPOSITORY** -- it is used for development only!
