# Hagenberg LaTeX Templates

## What you find here

This is a collection of modern LaTeX templates for university theses (bachelor, master or diploma programs) and related documents. Pre-configured templates for English and German are available, easy to use even for LaTeX beginners, compatible with LaTeX distributions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

## Document types

This template serves as an introduction for creating a bachelor's, master's or diploma thesis using LaTeX. It is the common standard for theses at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - School of Informatics, Communication and Media and also in use at other (mostly German-speaking) universities. The template is plain, immediately usable and easy to adapt. It should work in any LaTeX environment. The following templates are currently available:

* ``HgbThesisDE``, ``HgbThesisEN``: bachelor's, master's or diploma thesis (German/English),
* ``HgbInternshipReport``: internship report, a shortened thesis variant (German),
* ``HgbLabReportDE``, ``HgbLabReportEN``: lab report (German/English),
* ``HgbTermReport``: term report (English),
* ``HgbArticle``: generic journal article (English).

Each template is based on a custom LaTeX document class (e.g., ``hgbthesis.cls``) and multiplay style files  (``hgb.sty``, ...). These can also be used independently for other kinds of documents.
